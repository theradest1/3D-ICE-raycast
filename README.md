NOTHING HERE WORKS YET!

I am in the middle of a re-write so if you want a working program go to the "Old" branch:

https://github.com/theradest1/3D-ICE-raycast/tree/Old

# 3D-ICE-raycast
A 3D raycast programmed in ICE for the TI 84+ CE

All of this has been tested and works with my TI-84+CE (OS 5.3.0.0037)

--------------------------------------------------------------
Directions:

If you want to view the code before compiling, download the A3DICE file and send it to your calculator. You will be able to edit it like a TI-basic program but it wont run without compiling it with the ICE compiler. Go ahead and change a few things around for fun if you want :)

For the compiled program, download and send the A3DCOMP file to your calculator. It should run right away (you dont need to do anything with ICE or anything else before running it) If your calculator isnt OS 5.3 you may need to do Asm(A3DCOMP) by doing 2nd, 0, and the Asm( command will be on the 7th line. But you should really update to OS 5.3 (DONT DO ANYTHING ABOVE OS 5.3!!!) you can see you calculator version by pressing 2nd, mem, about.
