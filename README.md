I will be putting the last ICE raycast version here later today (only the compiled version because I deleted the editable)

# 3D-ICE-raycast
A 3D raycast programmed in ICE for the TI 84+ CE

All of this has been tested and works with my TI-84+CE (OS 5.3.0.0037)

--------------------------------------------------------------
Directions:

Download and send the ICERAY file to your calculator. It should run right away (you dont need to do anything with ICE or anything else before running it) If your calculator isnt OS 5.3 you may need to do Asm(A3DCOMP) by doing 2nd, 0, and the Asm( command will be on the 7th line. But you should really update to OS 5.3 (DONT DO ANYTHING ABOVE OS 5.3!!!) you can see you calculator version by pressing 2nd, mem, about.
